			<h2>How to Tech Tailgate</h2>
			<p>You are about to throw one of the the coolest, most radical tech parties in your city, are you ready? We have created this page of Tech Tailgate information to help you along. Since Tech Tailgate is still fresh we would love feedback on how this events goes over in your cities and ways we can keep making it better.</p>

			<h3>The Idea</h3>
			<p>Tech Tailgate started as simple as "Hey, we should have a pizza party!" Fargo Girl Develop It co-leaders Megan Beck and Shannon Wiedman had $100 to spend. A <a href="http://fargobrewing.com/" target="_blank">local brewery</a> had raised the money for Girl Develop It from a local brew pub crawl. There are quite a few tech meetups in Fargo and we wondered if we could bring them all together for a meetup of meetups. As it turned out, we could and Tech Tailgate was born.</p>

			<p>We were really hoping to get 50 people there. <a href="https://www.emergingprairie.com/tech-tailgate-gets-9-local-meet-ups-one-bumpin-party/" target="_blank">When 150 people showed</a>, we were pretty pumped. For us, that reassured our idea that something like this was needed and appreciated within our community.</p>

			<h3>The Must-Haves</h3>
			<p>We want to make sure that your Tech Tailgate event is successful, here are a few must-haves that will help you throw a tubular event.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="orange">Meetups</span> Tech Tailgate is nothing without the meetups. Make sure you have a good balance of tech meetups from your community. It is called TECH Tailgate for a reason, I'm sorry, but Grandma Nancy's Knick-Knack meetup will not be allowed to participate.</li>
				<li><span class="orange">Food &amp; Beverage</span> People love to eat and drink - it like keeps us alive or something. Think tailgating when selecting food and beverage for your event. If you are able to serve beer, go for it. Keep it simple though, providing our guests with food and beverage isn't our main mission but it will help get people there. If you are able to get it sponsored, great - if guests have to pay, that is fine too.</li>
				<li><span class="orange">Location</span> Yes, let's talk about that...</li>

			</ul>

			<h3>The Location</h3>
			<p>Of course we love the idea of cars pulling up, opening their tailgates and showing off their meetup groups that way, be we know that isn't always possible. Here are some options for locations for your event.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="orange">Brewery</span> If you have a brewery within your community that is large enough to allow for an event like Tech Tailgate, they are a good place to start.</li>
				<li><span class="orange">Parking Lot</span> Tailgates love parking lots. The only drawback is making sure you can get food and beverage there and all of the details that come along with not having the event at an established business.</li>
				<li><span class="orange">You Name It</span> Any place where you are able to make this event happen, try it out. Just make sure you have enough room for your meetups to have an area and your guests to mingle.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>The Meetups</h3>
			<p>The meetup groups are the most important part of Tech Tailgate. Do your research and pinpoint all of the tech meetups happening within your area that you think would be interested in attending your event. Be selective - here are a few things to consider when choosing meetups for Tech Tailgate.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="orange">Do they Care?</span> Make sure you have meetups that are interested in promoting themselves at the event <em>and</em> before the event. Require two people minimum from each meetup to be present at Tech Tailgate.</li>
				<li><span class="orange">Are they Tech?</span> This is a tech focused meetup, make sure your meetups have a tie in with your tech community. If you are ever wondering whether or not a meetup fits in - ask on slack and we will discuss.</li>
				<li><span class="orange">Hidden Agendas?</span> Make sure that the meetups you are selecting are meetups - not a group associated with a specific company. You might have companies ask to strut their stuff at your event. If this happens, ask them to sponsor but don't showcase them as a meetup.</li>
				<li><span class="orange">How Many?</span> How many do you have room for? Make sure you aren't crowded within the location that you select. Find a number that is comfortable for you and go with it. If you have to turn people away - tell them you will reassess at your next event to see if you have room.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Sample Meetup Invitation</h3>
			<div class="callout">
				<p><span class="orange">WE WANT YOU (Name of Meetup here)!</span></p>

				<p>You are cordially invited to be a part of a super awesome, fun event called TECH TAILGATE.</p> 

				<p>As nerds who run tech-related meetups in the Fargo area, we've always been interested in the other meetups that are also going on in the Fargo tech space. We would love to know more about them – Tech Tailgate let's us do that.</p>

				<p>Details:<br>
				When: Thursday, July 16th 2015<br>
				Where: Fargo Brewing parking lot<br>
				Time: 5:30-8 (or whenever... geeks like to party)</p>

				<p>Your meetup group would have a spot in the parking lot to "tailgate" and promote your meetup. We will invite members of meetups and the community to come and check out what Fargo's tech meetups have to offer. Fargo Brew will provide a couple pints for all the meetup leaders, as well as food and happy hour prices for everyone. There isn't much you need to do but show up and represent. We will provide you with a poster and possibly some other items, depending on sponsorships. Other than that, the rest is up to you! Tailgate however you would like to get people jazzed about your cause!</p>

				<p>What we need from you: First of all, a yes or no if you would like to be part of this amazing event. We already have some great meetups signed up to strut their stuff (Fargo Game Makers, Girl Develop It, Interface Fargo and Red River Web Group). You don't want to miss this (and come on, it's at Fargo Brew - who doesn't love beer?).</p>

				<p>If you could kindly respond with a yes or no by June 10th, that would be great so we can continue planning and keeping you informed as we go. Thank you so much – hope to see you and your tailgate on July 16th!</p>

			<h3>They said yes?! We need the following...</h3>
			<div class="callout">

				<p>We would love to get your information added to our Tech Tailgate website.</p>

				<p>What we need from you by (date):</p>
					<ul>

			<h3>The Sponsors</h3>
			<p>Finding sponsors for your Tech Tailgate event can help you throw the best tailgate party on whatever side of the Mississippi you are on. You can showcase their logo on your printed materials or let them walk around the event and pass out company materials. Just make sure they don't get more of a spotlight than the meetups - this event is for them. Here is what sponsors can help with.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="orange">Food &amp; Beverage</span> It doesn't hurt to try to lure people to your event with free food am I right?!</li>
				<li><span class="orange">Swag</span> Sponsors can provide funds to give away t-shirts during the event and other types of swag that have yet to be determined.</li>
				<li><span class="orange">Printing Costs</span> Printing posters, flyers and other materials for the event can add up fast.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Sample Sponsor Email</h3>
			<div class="callout">
				<p>Hello Company Name!</p>

				<p><em>Link to website</em></p>

				<p>We are looking for a couple more sponsors to round out this event and thought COMPANY NAME would make a great sponsor.</p>
